Modify Pool Member State
========================

It is a common task to modify pool member states to make application updates.
You will pass variables using ``extra-vars`` to override playbook variables.
Use the ``-e``, or ``--extra-vars`` argument of ``ansible-playbook``

**Create pool member forced offline playbook**

#. Create a playbook ``offline.yaml``.

   - Type ``nano playbooks/offline.yaml``
   - Type the following into the ``playbooks/offline.yaml`` file.

   .. code::

    ---

    - name: "Pool member offline"
      hosts: bigips
      gather_facts: False
      connection: local

      vars:
        pool: ""
        pmhost: ""
        pmport: ""
        state: "present"

      environment: "{{ bigip_env }}"

      tasks:
        - name: Modify pool member state
          bigip_pool_member:
            state: (( state ))
            session_state: "disabled"
            monitor_state: "disabled"
            host: "{{ pmhost }}"
            port: "{{ pmport }}"
            pool: "{{ pool }}"

#. Run this playbook enable pool member.

   - Type ``ansible-playbook playbooks/offline.yaml -e @creds.yaml --ask-vault-pass -e pool="hack11_pl" -e pmhost="10.1.20.17" -e pmport="80"``

#. Verify if pool member 10.1.20.17 is ``forced offline``

   - Select **Local Traffic -> Pools -> Pool List -> hack11_pl -> Members**
